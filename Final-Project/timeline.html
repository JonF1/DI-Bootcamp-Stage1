      <p class="timeline-paragraph">Gordon James Ramsay was born in the Scottish town of Johnstone. Ramsay's interest in cooking began in his teenage years; rather than be known as "the football player with the gammy knee", 
        he decided to pay more serious attention to his culinary education at age 19. Ramsay enrolled at North Oxfordshire Technical College, sponsored by the Rotarians, to study hotel management. 
        He describes his decision to enter catering college as "a complete accident".</p>
